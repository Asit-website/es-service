                        <p>There are over a thousand languages in the world, and due to the lack of a global official language, it is very difficult for content to be understood in every Country. This necessitates the need for translation. One might simply argue that translation can be performed by anyone who understands the respective languages. However, it is much more complex than that. A legal document cannot be translated in the same way as a literary document due to the existence of humor, emotions, etc in a literal content.</p>

                            <p>Dictionary explanation for apostille meaning just implicates as a French word that means ‘certification’, and in a formal context, an apostille is basically a formality of proving the authenticity and credibility of the document.When you apostille a document, an apostille sticker and/or an apostille stamp is obtained from the authority. It is a computer generated with a unique identification number and is applied to the back of the document. This maintains a record online and allows the concerned authorities to check the authenticity in a more convenient manner. After this application of the sticker from the MEA, there usually is no need for any added certification from the embassy.</p>
